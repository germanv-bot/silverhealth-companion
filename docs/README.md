# SilverHealth Companion - Project Overview

## Vision Statement

SilverHealth Companion is a web application designed specifically for people over 60 years old. The application helps users collect and organize their basic health metrics through an accessible, user-friendly interface, and generates helpful summaries and dietary recommendations.

## Core Purpose

- **Health Metrics Collection**: Gather basic health information (weight, height, waist circumference, medical conditions) via wizard
- **Doctor Summary Generation**: Create a non-medical summary document that users can take to their healthcare providers
- **Dietary Guidance**: Suggest appropriate diet plans and recipes based on user's health conditions
- **Direct Diet Plan Access**: Browse and generate meal plans without completing questionnaire
- **Custom Meal Plans**: Generate personalized 1, 2, or 3-day meal plans from predefined diet plans

## Key Principles

1. **Accessibility First**: WCAG AAA compliance with large text, high contrast, and clear navigation
2. **Privacy by Design**: All data collected anonymously and deleted immediately after use - no persistent storage of health information
3. **User Experience**: Simple, wizard-based interface with a reassuring and friendly tone
4. **Non-Medical**: The application provides informational summaries only, not medical advice
5. **Anonymous Usage Tracking**: Only an anonymous usage counter is maintained (no personal data)

## Target Audience

Primary users: Adults aged 60+ who need assistance tracking and organizing their health information for medical appointments.

## Project Status

**Status**: Initialization Phase  
**Last Updated**: Project Start
